I love every moment of being with you, and I hope we do for a while! See ya ^^", "Hey John! I laughed so hard at looking at this photo! It's been a great time spending the summer with you! I hope you visit my university soon too! - Ben Choi", "Yo Hannah! How's it going? it's been a while since I talked to you! I really miss you.
