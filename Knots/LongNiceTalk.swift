    var longSpeech = ["Hey Minty! Thank you so much for posting this photo on my wall! You're one of my best friends I ever had, and it means so much to keep this picture in my portfolio. I love every moment of being with you, and I hope we do for a while! See ya ^^", "Hey John! I laughed so hard at looking at this photo! It's been a great time spending the summer with you! I hope you visit my university soon too! - Ben Choi", "Yo Hannah! How's it going? it's been a while since I talked to you! I really miss you. From this picture, I was able to remember the best moments we had during our college years. It was so fun! We should totally hangout sometime :)", "If you're automatically sure that you know what reality is and who and what is really important, if you want to operate on your default setting, then you, like me, probably won't consider possibilities that aren't annoying and miserable. But if you've really learned how to think, how to pay attention, then you'll know you have other options. It will actually be within your power to experience a crowded, hot, slow, consumer hell-type situation as not only meaningful, but sacred -- on fire with the same force that lit the stars: love, fellowship, the mystical oneness of all things deep down.", "Empathy is a choice, and it's a vulnerable choice. Because in order to connect with you, I have to connect with something in myself that knows that feeling. ", "Either we heal as a team or we’re gonna crumble, inch by inch, play by play, till we’re finished. We’re in hell right now, gentlemen, believe me. And we can stay here and get the $&#@ kicked out of us, or we can fight our way back into the light. We can climb out of hell, one inch at a time.", "Really, when I look back on it, I wouldn’t change a thing. I mean, it was so important for me to lose everything because I found out what the most important thing is ... to be true to yourself. Ultimately, that’s what’s gotten me to this place. I don’t live in fear. I’m free. I have no secrets and I know I’ll always be OK, because no matter what, I know who I am."]
